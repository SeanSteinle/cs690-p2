This service is used to design the map in which we'll train our vehicle. You can access it by:

2. Go through 'My Account' > 'Licenses' > 'RoadRunner / Overview' to download and run the installer.
3. After the install finishes, you need to activate your license which you can do under 'Install and Activate'. Then you're good to go!
