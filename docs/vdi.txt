On the VM where you want to run the desktop.
=========================================
Note: This is for manual start up vnc for each user.
You may want to setup system wide vnc server.



In the home directory of the user, e.g. carla,
mkdir .vnc
create a file xstartup with these lines:
#!/bin/bash
xfce4-session

chmod +x xstartup


to launch vnc server with x server, run the command below. The vnc server will listen at port 5901 after this command:
vncserver :1 -localhost no

It will prompt to create password for remote access at first vncserver launch.


to stop the vnc server:

vncserver -kill :1


On your local MAC or PC
============================

create ssh tunnel:

Open a terminal and run this ssh
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 carla@[vm ip address}

Open a putty if using PC. At ssh tunnel part enter 5901:localhost for source and 5901 for destination. Then make the connection to the VM .


Once you have tunnel extablished, start your vnc client. e.g. RealVNC Viewer

Enter localhost and the port 5901 to connect.
